acme -m /mnt/acme .acme

# Tips

1. Selecting brackets (or whitespace, if it is on a standalone line) will
   select the content inside it. This can be useful for grouping commands.
   However, it's a good idea to create a single command, for commonly used
   functions.
2. The escape key (ESC) will select the content typed since last mouse action.
   If it's pressed again, it will cut the text. This is very handy in `win` to
   clear the output and re-execute a command.
3. `Edit =` will show the current line number.
4. Sam language can be used to combine commands:
   ```
   Edit , {
       d
       c/\n
   }
   ```
5. Scroll wheels can be used to expand and collapse `tags`.
6. Middle-click executes a content. If it's an Acme command like `Edit`, it
   gets executed by Acme; else it gets executed by the shell. You can
   middle-click on the filename in the tag to execute it (based on shebang).
   If you are already in `win`, it just passes it to the running process!
7. `Send` can be used to send the clipboard content to `win`. This can be used
   to send content from `tags`/`buffer` etc., to Shell, REPL etc.
8. Fonts can be changed using the `fontsrv` command.
9. The Rc functions available in the environment are available in Acme, but
   arguments might need to be single-quoted to work correctly.
10. You can make your own rules by creating a file called `$HOME/lib/plumbing`,
    starting the program called `plumber` and updating it:
   `cat $HOME/lib/plumbing | 9p write plumb/rules`
11. `sed` and `xclip` can be used to do vertical selection.
