# Tips

1. Left click places the cursor at the selected position.
2. Double left click selects text blocks (words, quotes, lines, brackets etc.)
3. Middle click executes selected content. If it's an Acme command like `Edit`,
   it is executed by Acme, else it is executed by the shell. You can middle
   click on the filename in the `tag` to execute it (based on the shebang). If
   you are already in `win`, it just `stdin`'s it to the running process. This
   can also be done by selecting the text with middle button. `Ctrl` plus left
   click simulates the middle button.
4. Right click performs action according to the `plumbing` rules. For e.g., if
   the selection is a file or directory, open it. If nothing matches, find the
   next occurence of the text. You can make your own rules:
   * Create a file called `$HOME/lib/plumbing`.
   * Start the program called `plumber`.
   * Update it:
   ```
   cat $HOME/lib/plumbing | 9p write plumb/rules
   ```
   This can also be done by selecting the text with right button. Shift plus
   left click simulates the right button.
5. Scroll wheel expand and collapse `tags`.
6. The escape key (ESC) the content typed since the last mouse action. If it's
   pressed again, it will cut the selection. This can be used in `win` to clear
   the output and re-execute a command.
7. `$%` refers to the current file.
8. Sam command language:
   * `Edit =` shows the current line number.
   * Clearing the editor and inserting a new line:
      ```
      Edit , {
        d
        c/\n
      }
      ```
   * `Edit X"." ...` executes edit over all open files.
9. `Send` sends the clipboard content to `win`. This can be used to send content
   from `tags`/`buffer` etc., to Shell, REPL etc.
10. The Rc functions available in the environment are available in Acme, but
    arguments needs to be single-quoted to work correctly.
12. Fonts can be changed using the `fontsrv` command.
13. `sed` and `xclip` can be used to do vertical selection.
14. Set `TERM=dumb` for `win` to work correctly.
