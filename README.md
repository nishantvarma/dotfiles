I ❤ minimalism and [suckless](https://suckless.org/)™ philosophy. See also
[plan9](https://plan9.io/plan9/) and [cat-v](https://doc.cat-v.org/).

# tl;dr

* outliner: filesystem
  * a folder can group ideas related to a topic.
  * it can contain other files/folders.
  * a link can create lightweight reference.
  * indirections can create complex graphs.
  * metadata like bookmarks, mrus  etc., are also files/folders.
  * fuzzy search can be used to quickly bookmark.
  * viewing, editing, opening, etc., can be delegated to shell scripts.
  * bind data + operations like oop.
* explorer: `vifm`
  * `vi`-like tui for outline operations.
  * everything is clickable.
  * everything opens in a new `dwm` window possibly `st`.
* editor: `vis`
  * `vi`-like bindings with structural regexp.
* window-manager: `dwm` or `bspwm`
* terminal: `st`
* shell: `rc`
* ide: `plan9port` + `suckless`

[The above information can be represented as an outline.]

Autogenerate outlines (like `zoxide`).

URLS can be opened via browser, but what about reverse?

Cooler FS'es?

Need to see if everything: window, process etc., can be mapped to an outline.
For example, `pid` 1 has a window `pid/win/1` and output `pid/out/1/<outline>`.

If interprocess communication happens via files (like Plan 9), such outlines
can integrate well with the environment, allowing for enhanced scripting
possibilities without creating new data-structures. A file-system can actually
store lists, dictionaries, trees etc.
